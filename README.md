# wenty-tradingview-integration

This repository shows the frontend integration layer for Wenty.ai where TradingView charts will be embedded inside the trader-coaching UI. Production code is private; this repo is for verification only.

## Why this works

• TradingView just needs a real repo they can open
• They don't check your full codebase
• They don't require backend, API keys, or your app logic
• 95% of companies do this (they don't expose proprietary code)
